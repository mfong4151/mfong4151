# Maxwell Fong - Software Engineer


### About me

I caught the coding bug during a college elective, but really started getting into it when I went to work for my dad. I spent the first few years of my career optimizing his company's SEO, and automating tasks around the office. After I retired him, I felt the next logical conclusion would be to explore software developement.
